# Reporting Security Issues

Security bugs are taken seriously. Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated.

To report a security issue, email [coderpatros@protonmail.com](mailto:coderpatros@protonmail.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

You will receive a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, you'll be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. You may be asked for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
